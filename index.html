      <h2>Q-1. What is React Js?</h2>
      <p>
        An open-source JavaScript package called React JS is used to create user
        interfaces, typically for mobile and single-page applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In React, a user interface is constructed from components. Each of these
        elements is a user-defined Javascript function.
      </p>
      <p>
        These components can take props (properties) as inputs and return React
        elements that specify exactly how a certain piece of the UI (user
        interface) should look in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commonly referred to as the root node, a single HTML element serves as
        the foundation for most React applications.
      </p>

        alt="img1"
      />

      <p>
        The only method to "change" a React element is to render a new one on
        the screen because React elements are immutable (cannot be changed).
        React keeps track of all these element changes in a Virtual DOM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calling the ReactDOM causes elements to be rendered on the screen.The
        createRoot() method compares the actual and virtual DOM elements with
        the least amount of modifications possible. In this diffing process, the
        ReactDOM always tries to avoid reloading the entire page, as
        demonstrated below:
      </p>

      <h2>Q-2. What is NPM in React Js?</h2>
      <p>The Biggest Software Registry (Library) in the World</p>
      <p>The biggest software registry in the world is npm.</p>
      <p>There are more than 800,000 code packages in the registry.</p>
      <p>To share software, open-source developers utilize npm.</p>
      <p>Npm is often used by businesses to control private growth.</p>

      <h3>Npm usage is free.</h3>
      <p>Use of npm is free.</p>
      <p>
        All npm public software packages are available for download without the
        need to register or log in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software can be downloaded and installed using the
        <strong>CLI (Command Line Client) </strong>provided by npm.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Windows Example</h3>
        <p>C:\>npm install &lt;package&gt; &lt;/package&gt;</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Installing Node.js with npm</h3>
      <p>Node.js is installed before npm.</p>
      <p>
        This implies that in order to install npm on your machine, you must
        first install Node.js
      </p>
      <p>
        Visit the official Node.js website at
        <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a> to get the software.
      </p>

      <h3>Manager of Software Packages</h3>

      <p>
        When npm was first developed as a package manager for Node.js, it went
        by the moniker npm (Node Package Manager).
      </p>
      <p>Package.json files, which are used to define all npm packages.</p>
      <p>JSON must be used to format the package.json file's content.</p>
      <p>
        The name and version fields must both be included in the definition
        file.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          { "name" : "foo", <br />
          "version" : "1.2.3", <br />
          "description" : "A package for fooing things", <br />
          "main" : "foo.js", <br />
          "keywords" : ["foo", "fool", "foolish"], <br />
          "author" : "John Doe", "licence" : "ISC" } <br />
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Taking Care of Dependences</h3>
      <p>Dependencies can be managed with npm.</p>
      <p>
        All of a project's dependencies can be installed using npm (in a single
        command line).
      </p>
      <p>In a package, dependencies are also defined.json.</p>

      <h2>Q-3.What is Role of Node Js in react Js?</h2>
      <h3>The top 5 benefits of using React Node.js</h3>

      <p>
        Here are 5 reasons to utilize React and Node js to streamline web
        development and create highly effective, scalable code.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Contributes to keeping a high server load</h3>
      <p>
        The inclusion of Node in your React project makes it incredibly simple
        for servers to manage server load balancing and simultaneous network
        requests.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Aids in keeping real-time data current</h3>
      <p>
        The combination of React with Node js is quite helpful if your app
        requires real-time data handling or data streaming. This is so that Node
        can manage ongoing server connections and React can render data on the
        front end.
      </p>

      <h3>3. facilitates the creation of single-page applications</h3>
      <p>
        You can simply build single-page applications like Gmail and Facebook
        using React and Node js. Intuitive UI/UX creation is possible with
        React, and callback-based asynchronous data loading is offered by Node.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Make creating JSON for your APIs easier</h3>
      <p>
        The internet data serialization standard known as JSON, or Javascript
        Object Notation, aids in the communication of data between a website and
        a server.
      </p>

      <p>
        JSON API is helpful for improving consistency in JSON answer formatting,
        and its effective caching features can reduce unnecessary server
        queries. It is quite effective to use the JSON API with Node, which
        encourages code reuse. Using React, the reusable code becomes shareable.
      </p>

      <h3>5. MERN stack project technologies</h3>

      <p>
        MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js are the major four
        technologies used by the MERN Stack application. We can develop
        applications like e-commerce and financial websites using this stack. To
        create apps quickly, developers simply need to be familiar with
        Javascript and JSON in addition to MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and
        React.js.
      </p>

      <h2>Q-4.What is CLI command In React Js?</h2>
      <h3>constructing a new program</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to construct React applications using construct
        React App.
      </p>
      <p>npx script use.</p>

      <div>
        <p>
          npx create-react-app &lt;react-app-name&gt; npx create-react-app
          hello-react-app
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>use the package manager npm.</p>

      <div>
        <p>
          npm init react-app &lt;react-app-name&gt; npm init react-app
          hello-react-app
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>yarn package management is used.</p>

      <div>
        <p>
          yarn init react-app &lt;react-app-name&gt; yarn init react-app
          hello-react-app
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>deciding on a template</h3>
      <p>
        Create React App uses the default template to create a React
        application. The original code having a specific built-in capability is
        referred to as a template. The npm package server offers hundreds of
        templates with a variety of sophisticated capabilities. Users of Create
        React App can choose a template by using the -template command line
        switch.
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>create-react-app my-app --template typescript</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The cra-template-typescript package from the npm server will be used to
        create a react app using the command above.
      </p>

      <h3>setting up a dependence</h3>

      <p>
        As React uses the project structure suggested by npm and yarn, React
        dependency packages can be installed using the standard npm or yarn
        package commands.
      </p>
      <p>use the package manager npm.</p>

      <div><p>npm install --save react-router-dom</p></div>

      <p>yarn package management is used.</p>

      <div><p>yarn add react-router-dom</p></div>

      <h3>launching the program</h3>

      <p>
        Depending on the package management being used in the project, the React
        application can be launched using the npm or yarn commands.
      </p>

      <p>use the package manager npm.</p>

      <div><p>npm start</p></div>

      <p>yarn package management is used.</p>

      <div>
        <p>yarn start</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Before launching the application, set the environment variable HTTPS to
        true in order to execute it in secure mode (HTTPS). For instance, the
        command below starts the application in HTTPS mode and sets HTTPS in
        Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>set HTTPS=true && npm start</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Q.5 What is Components in React Js?</h2>
      <p>
        One of React's fundamental building blocks is the component. Or, to put
        it another way, every application you create with React will be built up
        of what are known as components. Using components makes creating user
        interfaces considerably simpler. You can see a user interface (UI)
        divided into numerous separate parts, or components, and work on them
        independently before merging them all into a parent component to create
        your final UI.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see in the figure below, we have dissected the GeeksforGeeks
        homepage's user interface into its component parts.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230804155419/gfgdrawio-(1).jpg"
        alt="img"
        srcset=""
      />

      <p>
        React components essentially return JSX code that specifies what should
        be displayed on the screen.
      </p>

      <h3>Component types in ReactJS</h3>

      <p>
        There are primarily two categories of components in React:
        <strong>Functional Components:</strong> Javascript functions are what
        functional components are. Writing a javascript function allows us to
        build a functional React component. We shall discuss if these functions
        accept data as parameters later in the lesson. The example below
        illustrates a React component that is functionally sound:
      </p>

      <div>
        &lt;p&gt;function demoComponent() { <br />
        return (&lt;h1&gt; <br />
        Welcome Message! <br />
        &lt;/h1&gt;); <br />
        }&lt;/p&gt; <br />
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Class Components:</strong> Compared to functional components,
        class components are a little more sophisticated. While the class
        components can cooperate with one another, the functional components in
        your application are unaware of the other components. Data can be passed
        across class components by using the pass method. To develop class-based
        components for React, we can use JavaScript ES6 classes. A React
        component that uses classes is demonstrated in the example below:
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>
          &lt;p&gt;class Democomponent extends React.Component { render() {
          return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome Message!&lt;/h1&gt;; } } &lt;/p&gt;
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the two instances above, we developed components that are identical
        to one another, and we also described the key distinction between a
        functional component and a class component. In subsequent lectures, we
        will learn more about the characteristics of class-based components.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the time being, bear in mind that we won't employ functional
        components until we are certain that they don't need to communicate or
        collaborate with any other components. This means that while we can
        combine several functional components under a single functional
        component, these components do not require data from other components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class-based components can also be used for this purpose, although doing
        so is not advised because doing so will make your program less
        effective.
      </p>

      <h3>Component Rendering in ReactJS</h3>

      <p>
        User-defined component rendering is also possible with React. React
        allows us to start an element with a user-defined component and send
        this element as the first parameter to ReactDOM in order to render a
        component.The component can be passed as the first argument to the
        ReactDOM.render() method or rendered directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        How to initialize a component to an element is demonstrated by the
        syntax below:
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>const elementName = &lt;ComponentName /&gt;;</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Q.6 What is Header and Content Components in React Js?</h2>

      <p>
        An essential component of a website's design is the header. It
        represents the website's first impression. It offers practical links to
        other parts of the website that the user might find interesting. In this
        article, we'll use React.js and Material UI to build a working Header.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Approach:</strong> We will start by using some installs to build
        a simple react app. Using Material-UI, we will create a new Header
        Component with some decoration. We'll use the Material UI App Bar, which
        offers screen titles, navigation, and actions, to construct a header.
        Additionally, we will require an internal ToolBar to set the settings of
        the child components and position them all horizontally. Then, by
        importing the freshly built Header into our default Home page,
        represented by the App.js file, we will make some modifications. Let's
        now begin to make this.
      </p>

      <h3>React Application Development And Module Installation:</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the command below to create a React
        application:
      </p>

      <div><p>npx create-react-app foldername</p></div>
   

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2: </strong>Use the following command to move to your project
      folder after creating it, i.e., foldername:
    </p>

    <div><p>cd foldername</p></div>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Execute the following command to install the
      material-ui modules after building the React.js application.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        npm install @material-ui/core <br />
        npm install @mui/icons-material <br />
        npm install @mui/material <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Create a new file called Header.js in the "src" folder of the project.
      We'll put our header component in this file. The revised
      <strong>project structure</strong>
      will now appear as follows:
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211210165458/prjstr.PNG"
      alt=""
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> The header component will now be created. We'll
      use the Material UI App Bar Component.The top App Bar offers information
      and options relevant to the active screen. Branding, screen names,
      navigation, and actions all use it. It can change into a navbar or an
      action bar for the current context. The Material UI Tool Bar functions in
      conjunction with the AppBar rather than separately like other Material UI
      components. The settings of the toolbar component are set to the child
      component, which aligns them all horizontally.
    </p>

    <h3>Header.js</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        import * as React from "react"; <br />
        <br />
        // importing material UI components <br />
        import AppBar from "@mui/material/AppBar"; <br />
        import Box from "@mui/material/Box"; <br />
        import Toolbar from "@mui/material/Toolbar"; <br />
        import Typography from "@mui/material/Typography"; <br />
        import Button from "@mui/material/Button"; <br />
        import IconButton from "@mui/material/IconButton"; <br />
        import MenuIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Menu"; <br />
        <br />
        export default function Header() { <br />
        return ( <br />
        &lt;AppBar position="static"&gt;<br />
        &lt;Toolbar> <br />
        {/*Inside the IconButton, we <br />
        can render various icons*/} <br />
        &lt;IconButton <br />
        size="large"<br />
        edge="start"<br />
        color="inherit"<br />
        aria-label="menu"<br />
        sx={{ mr: 2 }} <br />
        &gt;<br />
        {/*This is a simple Menu <br />
        Icon wrapped in Icon */} <br />
        &lt;MenuIcon /&gt;<br />
        &lt;/IconButton&gt;<br />
        {/* The Typography component applies <br />
        default font weights and sizes */} <br />
        <br />
        &lt;Typography variant="h6" <br />
        component="div" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}&gt;<br />
        GeeksforGeeks Header <br />
        &lt;/Typography&gt;<br />
        &lt;Button color="inherit">Login&lt;/Button&gt;<br />
        &lt;/Toolbar&gt;<br />
        &lt;/AppBar&gt;<br />
        ); }
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the Header component has been created, it
      will be imported into App.js, where the following changes will be made.
    </p>

    <h3>App.js</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        import React from "react"; <br />
        import Header from "./Header"; <br />
        <br />
        function App() { <br />
        return ( <br />
        <br />
        // Using the newly created Header <br />
        // component in this main component <br />
        &gt;Header/&lt;<br />
        ); <br />
        } <br />
        export default App;<br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>How to run the program:</strong> Use the following command to
      launch the program from the project's root directory:
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npm start</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The <strong>output</strong> that appears when you visit
      http://localhost:3000 in your browser is as follows:

      Q.7 How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to
      Install NPM and How to check version of NPM?
    </h2>

    <p>
      React JS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that uses
      components. It is applied to the development of quick and engaging user
      interfaces for web-based and mobile apps. React needs less coding and
      offers more functionality, making it simple to construct dynamic
      applications. Both large MNCs and recent startups use it.
    </p>

    <h3>Features of React:</h3>

    <p>
      1. Reusable Components: Each component in a single React app has its own
      logic and code, but we can easily reuse components any number of times,
      saving developers' time and improving the effectiveness of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Debugging: "React developer tools" make it simple to debug React
      applications.It is a browser add-on that works with both Chrome and
      Firefox.
    </p>

    <h3>Reactjs setup for Windows:</h3>

    <p>
      Install the Windows Node.js installer as the first step. Select this link.
      Install the LTS version (located on the left) here. Click the Next button
      until NodeJS is fully installed after being downloaded, keeping all other
      settings in tact.
    </p>

      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter the command -> in the command prompt to see
      if it has been fully installed or not.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>node -v</p>
    </div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211013203241/cmd1.jpg"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      It will provide you with the installed version if the installation
      completed smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Execute the following command on the terminal:
    </p>

    <div><p>npm install -g create-react-app</p></div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211013211354/cmd2.jpg"
      alt="img"
      srcset=""
    />

    <p>
      React will be installed for you worldwide. Run the command to verify that
      everything worked as planned.
    </p>

    <div><p>create-react-app --version</p></div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015190556/cmd3.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      It will provide you the installed version of the React app if everything
      went correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Presently Using the command below, create a new
      folder where you want to create your react app:
    </p>

    <div><p>mkdir newfolder</p></div>

    <p>
      <strong> Note:</strong> The name of the folder, newfolder, in the command
      above can be anything.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015194724/Img3.jpg"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>Use the following command to move inside the same folder:</p>

    <div>
      <p>cd newfolder (your folder name)</p>
    </div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015195432/IMG5.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Execute the command -> inside this folder.</p>

    <div>
      <p>create-react-app reactfirst YOUR_APP_NAME</p>
    </div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015201442/immgg.jpg"
      alt=""
    />

    <p>The installation of the necessary components will take some time.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Names can no longer contain capital letters due to
      npm naming constraints; therefore, type your app's name in lowercase.
    </p>

      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Now open the IDE of your choice, such as Visual
      Studio Code, and navigate to the folder where you installed the React app.
      The folder will be called Newfolder in the example above, and inside it
      your project's name, reactapp, will be displayed. Use the terminal to
      navigate to the folder for your app name.Use the command cd reactapp (the
      name of your app).
    </p>

      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Execute the following command to launch your app:
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npm start</p>
    </div>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211015203947/img95.jpg"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      When you execute the aforementioned command, a new tab in your browser
      will open with the React logo as shown below:

    <h2>Q.8 How to check version of React Js?</h2>

    <p>
      A front-end Javascript library called React is used to create single-page
      applications (SPAs). Understanding the version can help you check for
      updates, understand the features that are currently available, and make
      sure that other dependencies are compatible. We will look at many ways to
      check the ReactJS version in this article.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll go over three approaches to determine the React version in this
      article.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>package.json file usage</li>
      <li>command line use</li>
      <li>Using React's default import's version property</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>using the package.the json file</h3>

    <p>
      Our project's metadata is contained in the package.json file. When we
      build our React project, it is automatically created. Using the command
      listed below, we can produce a react application.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npx create-react-app name_of_the_app</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Numerous name/value pairs in JSON format are found in the package.json
      file. As seen in the image below, we can quickly check the version of
      React by looking at the list of dependencies.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210923161201/packageoutput.png"
      alt=""
    />

    <h3>Command line usage:</h3>

    <p>
      The command listed below can be used on our command line to quickly check
      the React version.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npm view react version</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Below is a description of the output showing how to use the aforementioned
      command on the command line.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210923161200/cmdversion.png"
      alt=""
    />

    <strong>Using React's default import's version property: </strong>

    <p>
      The object that is imported by default from the React library has a
      version attribute. This property can be used inside our JSX elements
      whichever we like.
    </p>

    <p>Syntax: The version property's syntax is listed below.</p>

    <div>
      <p>import React from 'react'; let a = React.version</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Create a react project using the command that was covered in the article
      above in order to follow along.
    </p>

    <p>
      the App.js file The code below shows how to use the version property on a
      React object and includes a description of the App.js file's contents.
    </p>

    <h3>Javascript</h3>

    <div>
      <p>
        &lt;p&gt;<br />
        import React from 'react';<br />
        <br />
        const App = () => {<br />
        return &lt;h1&gt;<br />
        We are currently using react version {React.version}<br />
        &lt;/h1&gt;;<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        export default App;&lt;/p&gt;<br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>How to run the program:</strong> To launch the application, enter
      the following command on the command line.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npm start</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Output:</strong> Launch your browser and navigate to
      http://localhost:3000 to view the output listed below.
    </p>

    <h2>Q. 9 How to change in components of React Js?</h2>

    <p>
      When working on a single page application, changing the state of a React
      component is helpful since it allows the user to see new content without
      having to reload the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      The initial state value must be set in the constructor method, and the
      element whose click causes the state to change must have its click event
      handler defined. After that, give the function to the click handler and
      use setState to modify the component's state inside the function. The
      setState function is used to modify the component's state either directly
      or through the callback method described below.
    </p>

    <strong> Syntax: </strong>

    <div>
      <p>this.setState({ stateName : new-state-value})</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>this.setState(st => { st.stateName = new-state-value })</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong>Example 1:</strong> Using this example, you can see how to modify
      the component's state after a click.
    </p>

    <strong> index.js:</strong>

    <div>
      <p>
        &lt;p&gt;import React from 'react' <br />
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'<br />
        import App from './App'<br />
        <br />
        ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;,
        document.querySelector('#root'))&lt;/p&gt;<br />

      Q.12 Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with
      Hooks
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, we'll look at the lifecycle of a React component. A
      component's lifecycle begins with its initialization and ends when it is
      unmounted from the DOM. We will also go through each phase briefly.
    </p>

    <h3>Lifecycle of Components</h3>
    <p>
      Every React Component has its own lifecycle. A component's lifecycle can
      be defined as a collection of functions that are invoked at various stages
      of the component's existence. The definition is simple, but what do we
      mean by different stages? A React Component can go through the four stages
      listed below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Initialization: This is the stage at which the component is built with
        the specified Props and default state. This is done in a Component
        Class's constructor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mounting: This is the stage in which the JSX returned by the render
        function is rendered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updating: Updating is the stage in which a component's state is updated
        and the application is repainted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unmounting: As the name implies, this is the final step of the component
        lifecycle in which the component is removed off the page.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      React provides developers with a collection of preset functions that, if
      present, are invoked around specific events during the component's
      lifespan. Developers are expected to override the functions with necessary
      logic for them to operate properly. The gist is depicted in the diagram
      below.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions of each Lifecycle Phase:</h3>

    <strong> Initialization </strong>

    <p>
      The developer must define the props and initial state of the component
      during this step, which is often done in the component's constructor. The
      initialization procedure is described in the following code snippet.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        class Clock extends React.Component { <br />
        constructor(props) <br />
        { <br />
        // Calling the constructor of <br />
        // Parent Class React.Component <br />
        super(props); <br />
        <br />
        // Setting the initial state <br />
        this.state = { date : new Date() }; <br />
        } <br />
        } <br />
      </p>
    </div>

    <strong> Mounting </strong>
    <p>
      Mounting is the step of the component lifecycle in which the component's
      initialization is done and the component is mounted on the DOM for the
      first time on the webpage. Now, React follows a default approach in the
      Naming Conventions of these predefined functions, where functions
      containing "Will" indicate before some specified phase and functions
      containing "Did" represent after that phase is completed. The mounting
      phase is made up of two such specified functions, which are explained
      below.
    </p>

    <p>In the constructor, first initialize the data and states.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>componentDidMount() Function:</strong> This function is called
      immediately after the component is mounted on the DOM, i.e. after the
      render() function is called for the first time.
    </p>

    <strong>Updation </strong>

    <p>
      React is a JS package that makes it simple to develop Active web pages.
      Active web pages are now specific pages that respond to their user. Take,
      for example, the GeeksforGeeks IDE webpage; the webpage behaves
      differently with each user. User A could be writing C code in the Light
      Theme while another User is writing Python code in the Dark Theme. This
      dynamic behavior, which is largely dependent on the user, distinguishes
      the webpage as an Active webpage. How does this relate to updating?
      Updating is the process of updating a component's states and properties,
      which is followed by user activities like as clicking, pushing a key on
      the keyboard, and so on.The following are descriptions of functions that
      are called at various points during the Updation phase.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>getDerivedStateFromProps:</strong> The static method
        getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) is called shortly before the
        render() method in both the mounting and updating phases of React. It
        takes as arguments updated props and the current state.
      </li>

      <div>
        <p>
          static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {<br />
          if(props.name !== state.name){<br />
          //Change in props<br />
          return{<br />
          name: props.name<br />
          };<br />
          }<br />
          return null; // No change to state<br />
          }<br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <li>
        <strong>setState() Function:</strong> This is not a Lifecycle function
        and can be called explicitly at any time. This function is used to
        update a component's state. For further details, please see this
        article.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>shouldComponentUpdate() Function:</strong> By default, every
        state or props update re-renders the page, however this is not always
        wanted; sometimes it is preferred that updating the page does not
        re-paint the page. The shouldComponentUpdate() function satisfies the
        requirement by informing React whether or not the component's output
        will be affected by the update. When new properties or states are
        received, shouldComponentUpdate() is called before rendering an already
        mounted component. If returned false, the further rendering stages will
        be skipped. This function cannot be used in conjunction with
        forceUpdate(). The Function accepts the new Props and State as arguments
        and returns whether or not to re-render.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>function getSnapshotBeforeUpdate():</strong> The
        getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() function is called shortly before the DOM is
        rendered. It is used to save the previous state values once the DOM is
        modified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>componentDidUpdate() Function:</strong> Similarly, this function
        is invoked after the component is rerendered, i.e. after the render()
        function is executed following the update of State or Props.
      </li>

      <aside class="sep">
        <strong>Unmounting </strong>

        <p>
          This is the final phase of the component's lifespan, in which the
          component is unmounted from the DOM. This phase's single member is the
          following function.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <li>
        <strong>componentWillUnmount() Function:</strong> This function is
        called before the component is finally unmounted from the DOM, i.e. it
        is called once before the component is removed from the page, indicating
        the end of the lifecycle.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So far, we've reviewed every predefined function in the component's
      lifecycle, as well as the sequence in which the functions were executed.
    </p>

    <h3>Putting the lifecycle methods into action</h3>

    <p>
      Let's look at one more example to round up the subject while refining what
      we've already discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, create a react app and change the index.js file in the src
      folder.
    </p>
    <strong>index.js (source): </strong>

    <div>
      <p>
        import React from 'react'; <br />
        import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; <br />
        <br />
        class Test extends React.Component { <br />
        constructor(props) { <br />
        super(props); <br />
        this.state = { hello: "World!" }; <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        componentDidMount() { <br />
        console.log("componentDidMount()"); <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        changeState() { <br />
        this.setState({ hello: "Geek!" }); <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        render() { <br />
        return ( <br />
        &lt;div&gt; <br />
        &lt;h1&gt;GeeksForGeeks.org, Hello{this.state.hello}&lt;/h1&gt; <br />
        &lt;h2&gt; <br />
        &lt;a onClick={this.changeState.bind(this)}&gt;Press Here!&lt;/a&gt;
        <br />
        &lt;/h2&gt; <br />
        &lt;/div&gt;); <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) { <br />
        console.log("shouldComponentUpdate()"); <br />
        return true; <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        componentDidUpdate() { <br />
        console.log("componentDidUpdate()"); <br />
        } <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
        <br />
        root.render( <br />
        &lt;Test /&gt; <br />

      Q.14 Create React app with modules and lazy loading (Admin-user module
      with child Router and outlet)
    </h2>

    <h3>What exactly is lazy loading?</h3>

    <p>
      What exactly is lazy loading? Lazy loading is a design approach used to
      improve the performance of web and mobile apps. The idea behind lazy
      loading is straightforward: initialize things that are vital to the user
      interface immediately, then render noncritical stuff discreetly later.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you browse a website or use an app, you almost certainly aren't
      seeing all of the accessible content. You may never require certain
      components depending on how you explore and utilize the program, and
      loading unnecessary objects wastes time and processing resources. Lazy
      loading allows you to render components on demand, increasing the
      efficiency of your app and improving the user experience.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Implement Lazy Loading in React</h3>

    <p>
      React offers two capabilities that enable applying code-splitting and lazy
      loading to React components relatively simple: React.lazy() and
      React.Suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function React.lazy() allows you to render a dynamic import as a
      regular component. Dynamic imports are a kind of code-splitting that is
      essential for lazy loading. React.lazy(), a key feature of React 16.6,
      eliminates the requirement for a third-party library such as
      react-loadable.
    </p>
    <p>
      React.Suspense lets you specify the loading indicator if the components in
      the tree beneath it are not yet ready to render.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we get into React.lazy and React.Suspense, let's go through
      code-splitting and dynamic imports, explain how they operate, and break
      down how they help with lazy loading in React.
    </p>

    <h3>React code splitting</h3>

    <p>
      With the introduction of ES modules, transpilers like Babel, and bundlers
      like webpack and Browserify, it is now possible to develop JavaScript
      applications in a completely modular structure for easy maintenance. Each
      module is often imported and merged into a single file called a bundle,
      which is subsequently included on a webpage to load the complete app. As
      the software develops in size, so does the bundle size, which eventually
      affects page load speeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of breaking a huge bundle of code into numerous bundles that
      may be loaded dynamically is known as code-splitting. This allows you to
      prevent performance difficulties caused by big bundles without lowering
      the amount of code in your program.
    </p>

    <h3>React dynamic imports</h3>
    <p>
      Dynamic imports, which use the import() syntax, are one technique to
      separate code. Import() relies on JavaScript Promises to load a module. As
      a result, it provides a promise that is either fulfilled with the loaded
      module or denied if the module is unable to be loaded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's an example of dynamically importing a module for a webpack-bundled
      app:
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dynamic-import-webpack-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      When webpack finds this syntax, it understands to construct a separate
      bundle file for the moment library dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use a boilerplate like create-react-app or Next.js, code-splitting
      using dynamic import() happens on the fly for React projects. If you're
      using a custom webpack setup, you should see the webpack handbook for
      instructions on configuring code-splitting. To correctly parse dynamic
      import() in Babel, you must use the babel-plugin-syntax-dynamic-import
      plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further ado, let's get started with React.React and
      lazy().Suspense
    </p>

    <h3>Making use of React.lazy()</h3>

    <p>
      React.lazy() makes it simple to create components that are loaded
      dynamically but rendered as regular components. When the component is
      rendered, the bundle containing it is automatically loaded.
    </p>

    <p>
      React.lazy() accepts as an argument a method that must deliver a promise
      after loading the component with import(). The resolved promise points to
      a module with a default export that includes the React component.
    </p>

    <p>The syntax for using React.lazy() is as follows:</p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/react.lazy_-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />
    <h3>Making use of React.Suspense</h3>

    <p>
      React.lazy() components are only loaded when they need to be rendered. As
      a result, while the lazy component is loading, you should show some form
      of placeholder content, such as a loading indicator. This is precisely
      what React.Suspense is intended for.
    </p>
    <p>
      React.Suspense is a component used to surround sluggish components. A
      single Suspense component can wrap several lazy components at different
      hierarchy levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all the lazy components are loaded, the Suspense component accepts a
      fallback prop that accepts the React elements you want rendered as
      placeholder content.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/react.suspense-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      In this case, we developed a simple Loader component to provide as
      fallback content for the sluggish Calendar component. We also added an
      error barrier to show a message if the slow Calendar component does not
      load.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've wrapped the lazy Calendar import in another promise to mimic a
      five-second delay. I also used a condition to either import the Calendar
      component or deliver a promise that rejects to increase the odds of the
      Calendar component failing to load.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/react.lazy-calendar-import-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      The animation below demonstrates how the component will look when rendered
      with React.lazy() and React.Suspense.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/react-lazy-load-demo.gif"
      alt="img"
    />

    <h3>React components with named exports</h3>

    <p>
      React.lazy() currently does not support named exports for React
      components. You must reexport named exports containing React components as
      default exports in separate intermediate modules if you want to use them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assume you have OtherComponent as a named export in a module and want to
      load OtherComponent with React.lazy(). You'd make an intermediate module
      that reexports OtherComponent as the default export.
    </p>

    <p>Components.js:</p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/react-lazy-components-js-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>OtherComponent.js:</p>

    <img
      src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/react-lazy-other-components-js-1.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      React.lazy() can now be used to load OtherComponent from the intermediate
      module.
    </p>

    <h3>React's route-based lazy loading</h3>

    <p>
      You may implement route-based code splitting without utilizing an external
      package by using React.lazy() and React.Suspense. Simply transform your
      app's route components to lazy components and wrap all routes in a
      Suspense component.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code snippet below demonstrates route-based code splitting with the
      Reach Router framework.
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        import { Router } from '@reach/router'; <br />
        import Loading from './Loading'; <br />
        <br />
        const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./Home')); <br />
        const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./Dashboard')); <br />
        const Overview = React.lazy(() => import('./Overview')); <br />
        const History = React.lazy(() => import('./History')); <br />
        const NotFound = React.lazy(() => import('./NotFound')); <br />
        <br />
        function App() { <br />
        return ( <br />
        &lt;div&gt; <br />
        &lt;Suspense fallback={<Loading />}&gt; <br />
        &lt;Router&gt; <br />
        &lt;Home path="/" /&gt; <br />
        &lt;Dashboard path="dashboard"&gt; <br />
        &lt;Overview path="/" /&gt; <br />
        &lt;History path="/history" /&gt; <br />
        &lt;/Dashboard&gt; <br />
        &lt;NotFound default /&gt; <br />
        &lt;/Router&gt; <br />
        &lt;/Suspense&gt; <br />
        &lt;/div&gt; <br />
        ) }
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Q. 14 What is Redux?</h2>

    <h3>React Redux</h3>

    <p>
      Redux is a free and open-source JavaScript library for managing
      application state. The user interface in React is built with Redux. Dan
      Abramov and Andrew Clark were the first to launch it in 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      React Redux is the official React Redux binding. It enables React
      components to read data from a Redux Store and send Actions to the Store
      in order to update data. Redux aids app scaling by providing a logical
      mechanism to manage state via a unidirectional data flow model. React
      Redux is fundamentally straightforward. It subscribes to the Redux store,
      checks to see if the data your component requires has changed, and then
      re-renders your component.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flux influenced Redux. Redux researched the Flux architecture and
      eliminated superfluous complexity.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Redux lacks the Dispatcher idea.</li>
      <li>Redux only has one store, whereas Flux has several.</li>
      <li>Store will receive and handle the Action objects directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should you use React Redux?</h3>

    <p>The primary reasons for using React Redux are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The official UI bindings for react applications are React Redux. It is
        kept up to date with any API updates to ensure that your React
        components behave normally.
      </li>
      <li>It promotes 'React' architecture.</li>
      <li>
        It performs various performance optimizations inside, allowing
        components to re-render just when necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Redux Architecture</h3>

    <img
      src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/reactjs/images/react-redux-architecture.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>The components of the Redux architecture are described further below.</p>

    <p>
      <strong> STORE: </strong> A Store is a location where you can see the
      current state of your application. It manages the application's state and
      has a dispatch(action) method. It functions as the brain for all moving
      parts of Redux.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong> ACTION:</strong> An action is a payload that is sent or
      dispatched from the view. Reducers can read it. It is a simple object
      designed to store information about the user's event. It contains
      information such as the type of action, the time of occurrence, the
      location of occurrence, its coordinates, and the state that it seeks to
      modify.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Reducer :</strong>reads the payloads from the actions and then
      updates the store via the state. To return is a pure function.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation Redux</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong>React Redux requires React 16.8.3 or a later
      version.
    </p>

    <p>
      Install the following command to utilize React Redux with a React
      application.
    </p>

    <div><p>$ npm install redux react-redux --save</p></div>

    <img
      src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/reactjs/images/react-redux-installation.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <h2>Q. 15 What is Redux Thunk used for?</h2>

    <h5>
      Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions from Redux
      rather than just actions. This enables delayed activities, such as working
      with promises.
    </h5>

    <p>
      One of the main applications for this middleware is to handle asynchronous
      actions, such as utilizing axios to submit a GET request. We can use Redux
      Thunk to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise
      that is returned.
    </p>

    <h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>

    <p>
      Redux Thunk may be installed from the command line using npm install
      redux-thunk --save or yarn add redux-thunk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it is a Redux utility, you must also have Redux installed. It is
      activated after installation by calling applyMiddleware():
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; <br />
        import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; <br />
        import rootReducer from './reducers/index'; <br />
        <br />
        const store = createStore( <br />
        rootReducer, <br />
        applyMiddleware(thunk) <br />
        );
      </p>

      <h3>How to Make Use of Redux Thunk</h3>

      <p>
        After installing Redux Thunk and include it in your project with
        applyMiddleware(thunk), you can begin dispatching actions
        asynchronously.
      </p>

      <p>Here's an example of a simple increment counter:</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER'; <br />
        <br />
        function increment() { <br />
        return { <br />
        type: INCREMENT_COUNTER <br />
        }; <br />
        } <br />
        <br />
        function incrementAsync() { <br />
        return dispatch => { <br />
        setTimeout(() => { <br />
        // You can invoke sync or async actions with `dispatch` <br />
        dispatch(increment()); <br />
        }, 1000); <br />
        }; <br />
        }
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Here's how to configure success and failure behaviors after polling an
      API:
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        const GET_CURRENT_USER = 'GET_CURRENT_USER'; <br />
        const GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS = 'GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS'; <br />
        const GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE = 'GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE'; <br />
        <br />
        const getUser = () => { <br />
        return (dispatch) => { //nameless functions <br />
        // Initial action dispatched <br />
        dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER }); <br />
        // Return promise with success and failure actions <br />
        return axios.get('/api/auth/user').then( <br />
        user => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_SUCCESS, user }), <br />
        err => dispatch({ type: GET_CURRENT_USER_FAILURE, err }) <br />
        ); <br />
        }; <br />
        };
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>
      Q. 16 What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?
    </h2>

    <p>
      A component is a fundamental building part in React. In other words, every
      application you create in React will be built up of bits known as
      components. However, React has two kinds of Components:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. React.PureComponent:</strong> It is one of the most important
      methods for optimizing React apps. There is no need for the
      shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method when utilizing the pure component
      because the ReactJS Pure Component Class checks existing state and props
      with new props and states to determine if the component should re-render
      or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. React.Component:</strong>However, React.Component re-renders
      itself whenever the props supplied to it change, the parent component
      re-renders, or the shouldComponentUpdate() method is triggered. The React
      application is not optimized. They are simple and quick to construct, and
      they are ideal for very small UI views where a re-render would be
      insignificant. They offer clearer code and fewer files to manage.
    </p>

    <p><strong>When should you use React.PureComponent?</strong></p>

    <p>
      You have the option of using React.If any of the following circumstances
      are met, PureComponent will be preferred over React.Component:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The state/properties object should be immutable.</li>
      <li>There should be no hierarchy between states and properties.</li>
      <li>When data changes, you should call forceUpdate().</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Making a React Application:</h3>

    <p>
      <strong> Step 1: </strong>Run the following command to create a React
      application:
    </p>

    <div>
      <p>npx create-react-app functiondemo</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      <strong> Step 2: </strong> After creating your project folder, i.e.
      functiondemo, use the following command to navigate to it:
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>cd functiondemo</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Project Structure:</strong> It will look like the following.</p>
    <img
      src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201212224551/ProjectStructure.png"
      alt="img"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>In this example</strong>, we will create a name color application
      that changes the text color when the component is presented in the DOM
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>App.js:</strong> Add the following code to the App.js file. App is
      our default component, and that is where we have written our code.
    </p>
    <p><strong>React.Component usage:</strong></p>

    <div>
        <p>import React from 'react';   <br>
  
            class Comp1 extends React.Component {   <br>
              render() {   <br>
                console.log('Child Component is called');   <br>
                return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;   <br>
              }   <br>
            }   <br>
                <br>
            class App extends React.Component {   <br>
              state = { color: 'black' };   <br>
              render() {   <br>
                return (   <br>
                  &lt;div style={{ color: this.state.color }}&gt;  <br> 
                    &lt;Comp1 value="Rahul" /&gt;   <br>
                    &lt;button onClick={() => this.setState({ color: 'green' })}>   <br>
                      Change Color   <br>
                    &lt;/button&gt;   <br>
                  &lt;/div&gt;   <br>
                );   <br>
              }   <br>
            }   <br>
            export default App; </p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Steps for Running the Application:</strong> Run the program from the project's root directory by issuing the following command:
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>npm start</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Output:</strong>Now, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/; you should see the following output:

    <h2>Q. 17 What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
      its purpose?</h2>
  
     <h3>In React.js, use the Optional Second Parameter of setState.
  </h3>
  
  <p>Functions in my code that relied on a state would render with an earlier state rather than the updated one. This is due to the fact that setState is asynchronous. If I tried to console.log() a state before and after changing it, I would wind up logging the prior state. Assume that the value of event.target.value was 'hooray' and that the remainder of the App Component was properly configured in the following code snippet:
  </p>
  
  <strong>Example 1:</strong>
  
  <div>
      <p>
          class App extends Component {    <br>
          this.state = {   <br>
            sampleItem: 'test',   <br>
          }   <br>
         handleChange = (event) => {   <br>
             <br>
           console.log(this.state.sampleItem)    // step 1   <br>
             <br>
           this.setState({                      <br>
             sampleItem: event.target.value      // step 2   <br>
           })   <br>
          
           console.log(this.state.sampleItem)    // step 3   <br>
        };
      </p>
    </div>
      
  
      <p>This code would generate the following output:</p>
  
      <div>
          <p>test <br>
              test</p>
      </div>
  
      <p>Again, this is due to the fact that setState is asynchronous. When handleChange is called in response to an event, steps 1 and 3 occur before the state may be altered in step 2. Because sampleItem hasn't been updated from 'test' to 'hooray' yet, 'test' is printed twice. </p>

      <p>To address this issue, we may provide setState with an optional second parameter that is a callback function. This function is called immediately after setState completes setting a new state. If we rearrange our code as follows:</p>

      <strong>Example 2:</strong>

      <div>
        <p>
          class App extends Component {     <br>
          this.state = {    <br>
              sampleItem: 'test',    <br>
            }    <br>
          handleChange = (event) => {    <br>
                <br>
             console.log(this.state.sampleItem)              // step 1    <br>
                <br>
             this.setState({                       <br>
               sampleItem: event.target.value                // step 2    <br>
             }, () => console.log(this.state.sampleItem))    // step 3    <br>
          };    <br>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>We get the desired outcome printed out:
      </p>

      <div>
        <p>test <br>
          hooray</p>
      </div>


      <p>As the optional second parameter in Example 2, I used an anonymous arrow function. This anonymous function is invoked immediately after setState completes setting the new state to 'hooray' and prints out the new state.
        </p>


      <p>  This solves the asynchronous nature of setState. Rather than merely printing out a new state, we could easily construct a more complicated callback function that makes use of our new state. So, in Example 2, step 3 may look like this:</p>
    


      <div>
        <p>() => SomeComplexCallbackFunction(this.state.sampleItem)
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>This enables us to conduct actions quickly following a state change and be confident that whatever data we return will use the most recent state.
      </p>

      <h3>React Context API vs. Redux & useReducer
      </h3>

      <h3>Benefits of Redux
      </h3>

      <p>Why would you add another library for state management? I thought React already managed the state? That is correct, but imagine you have multiple components and pages, each of which must fetch data from various APIs and data sources and manage the state of how the user interacts with that data and the interface. Your app's state can quickly devolve into chaos. The following are the primary advantages that I have discovered:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Redux stores all of the state in one store, the single source of truth.</li>
          <li>  Predictable: Because your program uses a single store, syncing your current state and actions with other portions of your app is simple.</li>
          <li>Maintainability: Your code will be easier to maintain because Redux provides explicit standards on how to structure it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1. Setup</h3>

        <p>Let's begin by making a new React app with the default settings: <span>$ npx create-react-app redux-crud-app</span></p>

        <p>To begin, remove all files except App.js and index.js from the /src folder. Clear out App.js and just return one word for the time being. <span>$ npm run start</span> will launch the app.</p>









        <h3>2. Adding users from the state</h3>
        <h3>3. Creating a new user</h3>
        <h3>4.  Changing a user's information</h3>
        <h3>5. removing a user</h3>
          <h3>6. Asynchronously loading new users</h3>


          <h3>App.js</h3>


          <div>
            <p>
              function App() {    <br>
              return (    <br>
                &lt;h1&gt;Hi&lt;/h1&gt;    <br>
              );    <br>
            }    <br>
                <br>
            export default App;
          </p>
          </div>

          <p>Let's include a small CSS library to make our app appear great. For this article, I'll be using Skeleton CSS. Simply add the following line before the closing tag to index.html:</p>
            <span>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"
              href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/skeleton/2.0.4/skeleton.min.css" /&gt;</span>
          

          <p>On your localhost, the text should now be formatted. As a development dependency, let's install the standard React router package to handle our various pages:</p>

            <span>$ npm install react-router-dom --save
            </span>

          

          <h3>App.js</h3>

          <div>
            <p>import { Route, BrowserRouter as Router, Switch } from "react-router-dom";    <br>
    <br>
              import React from "react";    <br>
              import { UserList } from "./features/users/UserList";    <br>
                  <br>
              export default function App() {    <br>
                return (    <br>
                  &lt;Router&gt;    <br>
                    &lt;div&gt;    <br>
                      &lt;Switch&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/"&gt;    <br>
                          &lt;UserList /&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/add-user"&gt;    <br>
                          &lt;h1&gt;Add user&lt;/h1&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;Route path="/edit-user"&gt;    <br>
                          &lt;h1&gt;Edit user&lt;/h1&gt;    <br>
                        &lt;/Route&gt;    <br>
                      &lt;/Switch&gt;    <br>
                    &lt;/div&gt;    <br>
                  &lt;/Router&gt;    <br>
                );    <br>
              }</p>
          </div>

          <p>And add a the UsersList component for the layout:</p>

          <h3>2. Loading users from state</h3>

          <p>First we have to add the redux store to our application. Let's install react-redux and the redux toolkit:</p>
            <span> $ npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux --save</span>

            <p> Then create a file store.js with the following code:</p>

            <h3>store.js</h3>

            <div>
              <p>
                import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"; <br>
                <br>
                export default configureStore({<br>
                  reducer: {},<br>
                });<br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>We'll add Redux functions later to alter the state (reducers) here. We must now wrap our application within the store using Redux's provider wrapper:</p>

            <h3>index.js</h3>

            <div>
              <p>
                import App from "./App";      <br>
                import { Provider } from "react-redux";      <br>
                import React from "react";      <br>
                import ReactDOM from "react-dom";      <br>
                import store from "./store";      <br>
                      <br>
                ReactDOM.render(      <br>
                  &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;      <br>
                    &lt;App /&gt;      <br>
                  &lt;/Provider&gt;,      <br>
                  document.getElementById("root")      <br>
                );      <br>
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>Next, let's create the redux state and populate it with our users. Then, within our UserList component, we'll retrieve this state.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Adding a new user</h3>

            <div>
              <p>import { useState } from "react";   <br>
   <br>
                export function AddUser() {   <br>
                  const [name, setName] = useState("");   <br>
                  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");   <br>
                   <br>
                  const handleName = (e) => setName(e.target.value);   <br>
                  const handleEmail = (e) => setEmail(e.target.value);   <br>
                   <br>
                  return (   <br>
                    &lt;div className="container"&gt;   <br>
                      &lt;div className="row"&gt;   <br>
                        &lt;h1&gt;Add user&lt;/h1&gt;   <br>
                      &lt;/div&gt;   <br>
                      &lt;div className="row"&gt;   <br>
                        &lt;div className="three columns"&gt;   <br>
                          &lt;label for="nameInput"&gt; Name &lt;/label&gt;   <br>
                          &lt;input   <br>
                            className="u-full-width"   <br>
                            type="text"   <br>
                            placeholder="test@mailbox.com"   <br>
                            id="nameInput"   <br>
                            onChange={handleName}   <br>
                            value={name}   <br>
                          /&gt;   <br>
                          &lt;label for="emailInput">Email&lt;/label&gt;   <br>
                          &lt;input   <br>
                            className="u-full-width"   <br>
                            type="email"   <br>
                            placeholder="test@mailbox.com"   <br>
                            id="emailInput"   <br>
                            onChange={handleEmail}   <br>
                            value={email}   <br>
                          /&gt;   <br>
                          &lt;button className="button-primary">Add user&lt;/button&gt;   <br>
                        &lt;/div&gt;   <br>
                      &lt;/div&gt;   <br>
                    &lt;/div&gt;   <br>
                  );   <br>
                }</p>
            </div>

            <p>We want to add the user to the state and return the user to the UserList component when they submit. If something goes wrong, we'll display an error message. </p>

            <p>To begin, we will add a method/function to our Redux user slice. This method, which Redux refers to as a reducer, is used to change the state. Inside reducers, our function receives the user state and the action, in this case the user form field values.</p>

            <p>Redux generates an action for us to use when using this function.</p>


            <h3> 4. Editing a user</h3>

            <p>To edit a user, we'll first link our edit button to the dynamic /edit-user/id page within our UserList component:
            </p>

            <div>
              &lt;p&gt;&lt;Link to={`/edit-user/${id}`}&gt;  <br>
                &lt;button&gt;Edit&lt;/button&gt; <br>
             &lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/p&gt; <br>
            </div>

            <p>The new reducer will then be added to our Redux slice. It will look for the user in our state and update it if one exists.
            </p>

            <h3>usersSlice.js</h3>

            <div>
              <p>
                const usersSlice = createSlice({   <br>
                name: "users",   <br>
                initialState,   <br>
                reducers: {   <br>
                  userAdded(state, action) {   <br>
                    state.push(action.payload);   <br>
                  },   <br>
                  userUpdated(state, action) {   <br>
                    const { id, name, email } = action.payload;   <br>
                    const existingUser = state.find((user) => user.id === id);   <br>
                    if (existingUser) {   <br>
                      existingUser.name = name;   <br>
                      existingUser.email = email;   <br>
                    }   <br>
                  },   <br>
                },   <br>
              });   <br>
            </p>
            </div>

            <p>Our EditUser.jsx file will look quite similar to AddUser.jsx, except that now we utilize the useLocation hook from react-router-dom to get the user id from the URL path:
            </p>

            <h3> 5. Deleting a user</h3>

            <p>I'd like to invite you to solve this one for yourself! It will be a good exercise to put what we've learnt so far into practice. </p>

            <p>My answer for the reducer is as follows:</p>

            <div>
              <p>userDeleted(state, action) { <br>
                const { id } = action.payload; <br>
                const existingUser = state.find((user) => user.id === id); <br>
                if (existingUser) { <br>
                  return state.filter((user) => user.id !== id); <br>
                } <br>
              },</p>
            </div>

            <h3>6. Loading new users asynchronously</h3>

            <p>Warning: the following section is a little more difficult but extremely beneficial to understand!</p>

              <p> A useful feature would be the ability to import users from an external API. We'll make advantage of this free one: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
              </p>

              <p>  Only synchronous code is executed by Redux. To handle async code, it was most popular to utilize a redux-thunk, which is simply a basic function that accepts async code as actions.</p>

              <p>   Redux now provides a built-in capability for adding async code. Many tutorials still require redux-thunk, however redux's new configureStore function already includes this.</p>

              <p> Let us now include the API fetch in our usersSlice:</p>

              <div>
                <p>export const fetchUsers = createAsyncThunk("fetchUsers", async () => {  <br>
                  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");  <br>
                  const users = await response.json();  <br>
                  return users;
                });</p>
              </div>

              <p>Then, within our slice, we'll add a property called <span>extraReducers</span>, which will have a couple of functions to handle the API's return:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>pending </li>
                <li>  fulfilled</li>
                <li> rejected</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Our API call returns a Promise, which is an object representing the state of an asynchronous activity, in this case an API call. We'll update our status based on the Promise status.
              </p>

              <div>
                <p>const usersSlice = createSlice({    <br>
                  name: "users",    <br>
                  initialState: {    <br>
                    entities: [],    <br>
                    loading: false,    <br>
                  },    <br>
                  reducers: { ... },    <br>
                  extraReducers: {    <br>
                    [fetchUsers.pending]: (state, action) => {    <br>
                      state.loading = true;    <br>
                    },    <br>
                    [fetchUsers.fulfilled]: (state, action) => {    <br>
                      state.loading = false;    <br>
                      state.entities = [...state.entities, ...action.payload];    <br>
                    },    <br>
                    [fetchUsers.rejected]: (state, action) => {    <br>
                      state.loading = false;    <br>
                    },    <br>
                  },    <br>
                });</p>
              </div>

              <p>This array of users should be retrieved as soon as our program loads and whenever a user clicks the LOAD USERS button.</p>
              <p> Let's dispatch it before our component inside index to load it as soon as our app loads.js:</p>

              <span>store.dispatch(fetchUsers())</span>

              <p>And to dispatch it on our button:</p>

              <span>onClick={() => dispatch(fetchUsers())}</span>

              <p>That's it! We finished building our CRUD app using React, Redux and Hooks.</p>
